Experience Log 

PROBLEM
When I first started at Barton S, no operations were in place to maintain a physical inventory of over 30,000 items. Items were often short or missing from the shelf. Multiple employees were responsible for maintaining inventory sections by sight using handwritten lists. 

ANTICIPATED CONSEQUENCE
After tracking the impact of lost sales, the company lost over $60K per quarter plus the additional lost time spent manually creating order lists. 

ROLE
I was the IT Office Manager. I was responsible for the ERP software solution implementation and training.

ACTION
My first action was to build reporting for sales forecasting and suggested ordering based on historical sales. I trained each employee responsible for purchasing how to generate the reporting and purchase requests. I also used these values this to create minimum and maximum ordering product levels. 

I then had to address the physical stocking locations since the spacing for products did not match the required space needed for the average stocking levels. I worked with the warehouse staff and designed a mapped floorplan and location system to reorganize the warehouse. 

After the stocking locations were organized, I created a labeling and barcode system to map the stock to the new physical inventory shelving locations.

DECISION-MAKING RATIONALE
I started with the initial reporting and forecasting to enable the current purchasing department to retain manual control over the inventory process. This immediately relieved the manual method, reduced missed items, and slowly improved team confidence in the system. This slowly built trust and brought everyone together to actively participate in implementing the plan. 

I initially considered only implementing the reporting functionality as there were many other obstacles to overcome for a proper inventory count. After reviewing the options with the team and owners, the decision was made to invest toward more efficient warehousing and accurate inventory. 

END-RESULT
As a result of this project, the average sale values increased and lost sales reporting decreased by over 70%. The reorganization of the warehouse also provided room for an additional product line that added over $100K in sales per year. It also set the stage for creating a complete inventory system.
