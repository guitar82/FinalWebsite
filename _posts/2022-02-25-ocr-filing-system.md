PROBLEM
The company sales were generating large amounts of manual paperwork. All accounts receivable customer invoices were handwritten on three-part carbon copy, a customer copy, a filing copy, and a packing slip. After the sales transaction, an employee was dedicated to entering all invoices. Each copy then required filing in separate cabinets as it moved through the order to cash process.  The customers were provided priced invoices one day per month when the statements were mailed.

ANTICIPATED CONSEQUENCE
As the company continued to grow, the process would soon require additional clerical staff, and the added workload was increasing the rate of billing errors. Customers will continue to call for copies of invoices and billing disputes. 

ACTION	
I first meet with management to discuss potentially eliminating the handwritten process. The owners did not want to increase customer transaction time while their invoices were typed into the system. Since the invoices needed to remain handwritten, I had to develop another solution to allow digital delivery. I researched various solutions until I came upon a company (SDSI UnForm)  offering a unique digital filing program with OCR capabilities. 
I set up daily batches and OCR rules to process PDF copies of the invoices and deliver them via fax and email. After this was tested and functional, I created a process to add a barcode sticker on the handwritten packing slips. This allowed me to batch OCR the handwritten packing slips and pair them accurately with the printed copies. 
After this was functional, I implemented a customer-facing web portal with access to the packing slips and invoice copies. Once complete, documents were only hand processed for customers who requested mailed copies. 

DECISION-MAKING RATIONALE
Electronic delivery provided the most significant business impact. However, due to the reliability of fax or email, I felt the customer-facing portal would be essential to the success of the process. I knew the handwritten process would still present issues, but this was a necessary step toward the adaption of entering invoices at the point of sale. 

END-RESULT
The program reduced daily filing by 80%. It also nearly eliminated customer requests for invoice copies. This improvement allowed the existing clerical staff to take on additional roles within the company.
