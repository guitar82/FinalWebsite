Experience Log 

PROBLEM
The current point of sale program created bottlenecks at the point of sale. The program required knowledge of part numbers or exact keyword descriptions to look up items, which would cause a considerable delay at the point of sale. As a result, the owners had decided to handwrite all invoices, and one person was tasked with entering them after the sale.

ANTICIPATED CONSEQUENCE
Customers would continue to be delayed causing potential loss of satisfaction. The store would also be unable to keep accurate live inventory information due to the delayed entry of sales. One employee was responsible for all pricing, and other employees would not bother to learn the system. 

ACTION	
I made a list of all the company’s pain points to remove the reliance on handwritten tickets. I also worked with the President and Vice President to gather their input on improving the customer experience. 

The first step I took was to address the quality of the existing data. I involved the purchasing team to ensure vendor item numbers matched the published price sheets. This would ensure that as the inventory turned, I would import new descriptions and UPC barcodes from the vendor-published price sheets. 

After a few months of ordering, I could bulk import a large percentage of the UPCs into the system. This enabled me to introduce barcode scanners to the point-of-sale terminals to relieve most of the stock number knowledge requirements. 

After this was completed, I reached out to NCR and similar companies to see how their solutions would address our other issues. I decided NCR Counterpoint SQL would provide the best value and address the point-of-sale issues. 

I performed all data transformations for the new system and created testing and training environments for all employee teams. In collaboration with NCR, I provided training to all employees and worked with each department to optimize and refine their daily workflow processes. 

Before going live, I installed and configured new point of sale terminals with customer-facing credit card readers, barcode scanners, and printers for the new solution. 


DECISION-MAKING RATIONALE
I started with improving our existing data and process to realize those values even if an appropriate solution wasn’t found. I knew I needed all employees to contribute to the success of the upgrade. I brought key employees on each team into the process to ensure everyone shared responsibility for the upgrade. 


END-RESULT

Upon going live, the new system has decreased the average transaction time by over 200% due to the live keyword searching and data improvements. Customer satisfaction increased dramatically, and sales increased by over 30%. There was an initial learning curve for the sales counter team, and tickets had to be manually reviewed for accuracy until they had achieved a more robust level of proficiency.
